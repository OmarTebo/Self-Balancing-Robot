# Project Preferences and Guidelines

## Code Editing Rules

1. **Do NOT edit the project flow itself** unless directly prompted by the user
   - This means: don't modify core functionality, control loops, or architecture without explicit request
   - Only make changes when the user explicitly asks for them

2. **Command Line Execution**
   - **DO NOT execute commands** without explicit user request
   - **Exception**: When making code pivoting/refactoring changes, always git commit the changes
   - Always ask before running build commands, test commands, or any terminal operations

3. **Git Operations**
   - When making significant code changes (refactoring, dead code removal, etc.), commit the changes
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Don't push unless explicitly asked

## Current Project Context

- This is an ESP32-based self-balancing robot project
- Uses PlatformIO for build system
- Main components: IMU, PID controllers, motor drivers, BLE, Serial bridge
- Documentation exists in DOCUMENTATION.md
- Dead code has been identified in DOCUMENTATION_INCONSISTENCIES.md

## Next Steps

- User plans to clean dead code in the next session
- Dead code identified:
  - Standalone `compute()` function in PIDController.h
  - `SerialCmdResult` struct in SerialBridge.h
  - `beginMPU()` and `beginBNO()` declarations in IMU.h
  - Potentially unused display.h/display.cpp files
